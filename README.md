# Business World Website
This Project website is  made by HTML , CSS and Javascript. It is totally responsive website in which we made various sections like home , about and service. There is also a toggle-bar which is active by javascript code when me convert display screen.

* Structure: The website is made up of multiple HTML files, each containing different sections such as the home page, about page, and service page. The sections are linked together using hyperlinks and a navigation menu.

* Responsive Design: The website is designed to be responsive, which means it can be viewed on different devices, such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, and the layout adjusts to fit the screen size. This is achieved using CSS media queries and responsive design techniques.

* Styling: The website is styled using CSS to create a visually appealing and consistent design across all pages. This includes the use of fonts, colors, layout, and other design elements.

* JavaScript: JavaScript is used to add interactive features to the website, such as the toggle-bar. The toggle-bar is activated using a JavaScript function that changes the display property of the toggle-bar element when the screen size is reduced.

* Toggle-Bar: The toggle-bar is a feature that allows users to access the navigation menu on small screens, such as smartphones. When the screen size is reduced, the toggle-bar appears, and when clicked, it expands to reveal the navigation menu.

* Home Section: The home section is the landing page of the website and includes a summary of the website's content and features. It may include a banner, call-to-action buttons, and other elements designed to engage and inform visitors.

* About Section: The about section is where the website provides information about the company, team, or purpose of the website. It may include a description, history, and other details.

* Service Section: The service section is where the website showcases the products or services it offers. It may include images, descriptions, pricing, and other details to help visitors understand what the website can provide.

In summary, a website project made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be a powerful tool for creating a responsive, visually appealing, and interactive website. By including multiple sections such as the home, about, and service sections, and using JavaScript to add features like the toggle-bar, the website can provide a comprehensive and engaging user experience.
